Hello, friend!

I'm in the process of creating a vocabulary card game tailored for children.
For this, I require images that are vivid, cartoon-styled, and represent the essence of specific words.

When generating these images, please ensure:

* They are colorful and cartoon-styled.
* They are square-shaped.
* They vividly represent the word's concept through various scenes.
* The word itself should not appear in the image or be used in the prompt for image generation.

With the above guidelines in mind, I'll provide you with words individually.
