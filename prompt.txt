Hello, buddy.

I wanna design a card game on vocabulary for kids, so I need cartoon style pictures and example sentences of each word.

Plese generate colorful cartoon-style images representing the concept of a given word.
The images should be square-shaped and include various scenarios related to the word.
the word itself should not be included in the image or the prompt to generate the image.

This is the setting. I will then give you the words one by one.
